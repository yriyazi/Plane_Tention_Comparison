This repository contains the code and data for the "Plane_Tension_Comparison" project, which is an optional project for the course "Mechanical Design I." The main objective of this project is to investigate stress concentration in a plane under tension and compare the results obtained from numerical simulations using different software packages.

## Introduction

The "Plane_Tension_Comparison" project aims to explore the concept of stress concentration, a phenomenon where the stress in a material is significantly higher in the vicinity of certain geometric features or defects. The project focuses on analyzing the stress concentration in a plane subjected to tension using various simulation tools.

## Stress Concentration

Stress concentration occurs when there are abrupt changes in a material's geometry, leading to localized areas of elevated stress levels. This can result in premature failure of the material under loading conditions. Detailed information about stress concentration can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_concentration).

## Numerical Simulations

To investigate stress concentration, numerical simulations were conducted using three different software packages: Abaqus, Ansys, and Solidworks. The simulations involve subjecting the plane to tension and analyzing stress distribution patterns.

## Model Validation

Before performing the stress concentration analysis, a model validation process was conducted. This involved subjecting the software packages (Abaqus, Ansys, and Solidworks) to a simple plane stress scenario. The results were compared to known analytical solutions to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the simulation setups.

The validation data and modeling details are available in the [Model Validation Folder](model_validation/).

## Project Files

The project files are organized as follows:

- **model_validation/**: Contains files related to the model validation process.
- **numerical_simulations/**: Includes input files and data for the stress concentration simulations using Abaqus, Ansys, and Solidworks.
- **results/**: Contains the results obtained from the numerical simulations.
- **report.pdf**: A detailed report summarizing the project objectives, methodologies, results, and conclusions.

## Usage

To reproduce the simulations or explore the project further, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Plane_Tension_Comparison.git`
2. Navigate to specific directories for simulation setups and validation data.
3. Refer to the instructions in each directory's README for simulation setup and execution.

## Results

The results of the stress concentration analysis are presented in the [Results Folder](results/). The results are tabulated, showcasing stress distribution data obtained from Abaqus, Ansys, and Solidworks simulations.
